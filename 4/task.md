You want to exchange 400 EUR to CLP (chilean peso) and get 410 EUR after exchanging it back. Write a script which calculates in how
many days in the last 365 days had exchange rates which would give such return. Exchange rates can be
downloaded from [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kv109/91185723a2243b4ca3e31a37ce95dac4/raw/34c125738cd0bfbb9384757ef870b1e540bad147/EUR-CLP.json).
Downloading the data should be part of the script.

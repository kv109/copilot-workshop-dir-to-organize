Create a script that merges data from multiple CSV files and exports it to a JSON file.
Each input CSV file has the same structure, and the script should ensure no duplicate rows are present in the output JSON file.
Example CSV files can be found here:
- https://github.com/kv109/copilot-workshops/blob/main/6/csv-files/1.csv
- https://github.com/kv109/copilot-workshops/blob/main/6/csv-files/2.csv
- https://github.com/kv109/copilot-workshops/blob/main/6/csv-files/3.csv

Downloading the data should be part of the script.
